## Cypress/Cucumber for JavaScript (cc4js)

<br/>

Utilties and tools for automated integration testing of applications with Cypress/Cucumber.  For example, common Cucumber step definitions to logon, and manipulate basic HTML form widgets.  Assumptions are that the appropriate GitHub repository and Cypress.io project have been created for the system under test.

(For instructions on how to setup a testing project and creating the dependency to 'xcom-cypress-cucumber-4js', refer to the 'xcom-cypress-cucumber-4js-sandbox'. )
